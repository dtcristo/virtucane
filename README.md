Virtucane
=========
An assistive "virtual cane" app for the visually impaired. Once complete, it will assist blind people with everyday tasks. One of which is environmental text recognition. In the future, this may extend to localising an individual in a large environment (such as a shopping centre or airport).

There are two main aspects of this project:

* A set of command line tools for text recognition and simulation.
* A deployed implementation on Android.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dtcristo/virtucane/wiki) for further documentation on the project.

Text recognition tools
----------------------
These tools are used for testing various text localisation and identification algorithms before final impementation in Android.

For past developments in text recognition, see the [dtcristo/read_text](https://github.com/dtcristo/read_text) repository.

Android implementation
----------------------
The subfolder "android" is an implementation of the project on Android. Current development status is **incomplete**.
